# PR Plan

##

As I begin to update my website, I need to share it on LinkedIn and with my network to gain any leads I can.

The PR plan is relatively straightforward and I will aim to do the below:

- Share my website on Linkedin On a Tuesday/Wednesday morning. My friend has previously shared some information with me on the optimum time to share LinkedIn content and how the number of likes received within shortly posting it, influences how it appears on other feeds. So I will ensure that prior to sharing it, I have warned some close friends/network so they can like it shortly afterwards
- I will post each page of the website separately. 
  - One post for the Home Page
  - Another post for the about us
  - Another post for case studies etc.


This is a draft PR plan, which can be updated based on received feedback.

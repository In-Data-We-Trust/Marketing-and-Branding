## Goals

Below are goals for launching a data consultancy:

- Work on interesting challenges for great clients. Going to work should be enjoyable and that is at the core of the type of work and clients we will take on.
- Solving real client problems/challenges. Applying our minds to help clients early on in their data journey or to resolve complex existing challenges. We will want a longer term view with each client to understand how they can transition away from us to a BAU / more cost Effective model
- Scale out the company to have:
  - 2 people solving client challenges through *In Data We Trust* before end of ***March 2023***
  - 4 people solving client challenges through *In Data We Trust* before end of ***September 2023***
- Grow the company as large as possible ***BUT*** in an organic way. This means only working with capable people to fulfil roles. If we can't fulfil a role with a good quality resource, then we will turn down the role.
- More time to spend doing what I love without compromising on quality of life. Dog Walks, Family time and catching up with friends.

## Overview

### What Problem was resolved?

AB after launch, started to see a growth in the number of mortgage applications. There was an existing workflow however it had a number of issues that couldn't be resolved to resolve the management of the workflow challenges.

Existing problems involved existing teams not having an easy way to see the most urgent applications to review and next steps to be carried out. Trying to make these changes within the existing systems would have taken a considerable amount of time which would have lost AB a competitive edge and create unhappy customers. 

By conducting a discovery exercise to break the challenge down, we were able to provide a daily report for each team that shows which applications needed to be actioned and how long the outstanding task was. This meant every customer application could be acted upon in a timely way, suppliers were a Happy AB user and saw quick turnaround times.

This led to the continued great feedback AB receives from customers and helped it on it's path to continue growing whilst keeping customers at the focus.


### How did we do it?

To resolve the problem we did a discovery exercise where we did the below:

- Understand the business process and workflow across operations, finance and underwriting team
- Match the business process and workflow against the back-end systems
- Understand how data was generated from every single action a user took, and understand exactly where this information was stored (Note, sometimes key information generated like a expected income or expected valuation, is stored in custom_field_1) 
- Where ambiguity persisted, we would test the systems with the team, validate our understanding obtaining quick feedback which let us move quickly
  - This is where working in data becomes like a detective and can be considered an art that blends business analytics with engineering tools
- The entire process was understood across both front end and back end, which resulted in a 

Once we found out the above, we chose the relevant, simplest technology tools to resolve the challenge. In this scenario.

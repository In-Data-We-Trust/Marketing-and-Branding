## Overview

### What Problem was resolved?

AB after launch, started to see growth in the number of mortgage applications. There was an existing workflow however it had a number of issues that couldn't be resolved to resolve the management of the workflow challenges.

By conducting a discovery exercise to break the challenge down, we were able to provide a daily report for each time that shows which applications needed to be actions and how long the outstanding task was. This meant every customer, supplier was a Happy AB user and saw quick turnaround times.


### How did we do it?

To resolve the problem we did a discovery exercise where we did the below:

- Understand the business process and workflow across operations, finance and underwriting team
- Match the business process and workflow against the back-end systems
- Understand how data was generated from every single action a user took, and understand exactly where this information was stored (Note, sometimes key information genererated like a expected income, is stored in custom_field_1) 
  - This is where working in data becomes like a detective and can be considered an art that blends business analytics with engineering tools

Once we found out the above, we chose the relevant, simplest technology tools to resolve the challenge. In this scenario.

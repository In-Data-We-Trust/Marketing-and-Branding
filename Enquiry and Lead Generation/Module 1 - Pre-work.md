# Module 1.2 - Choosing your Target

Pick one particular target, and create a campaign for them. 

For example, if you work in FS, Public Sector and Retail - the messaging that converts/attracts will be different.

## Task 1 - Who's your Ideal Customer?

The information for this has been filled out in a word document template - this can be uploaded to here once finalised. 

The module 1, problems, goals were shared with the support group. And they helped refine the messaging that can be built on, which links back to quote reference in module 1.3.
